This app uses logistic regression models trained on Baseball Databank data to:
- Show which statistics are most influential for pitchers vs. non-pitchers
- Estimate a playerâ€™s probability of Hall of Fame induction based on career stats

You can input custom stats or explore stat importance below.
Note: The databank only contains/considers stats up to 2015.
